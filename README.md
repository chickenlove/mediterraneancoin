What is Mediterraneancoin?
----------------

Mediterraneancoin is a lite version of Bitcoin using an experimental new proof-of-work algorithm.

The new PoW algorithm is called "hybridScryptHash256".

It is described here: http://www.mediterraneancoin.org/hybridscrypthash256.pdf


 - 1 minute block targets
 - about 6 hour to retarget difficulty

Special reward system: random block rewards

blocks:
1-100k   : random 0-1000 MediterraneanCoins reward
100k—200k: 0-500 MediterraneanCoins reward
200k—300k: 0-250 MediterraneanCoins reward
300k—400k: 0-125,000 MediterraneanCoins reward
400k—500k: 0-62,5 MediterraneanCoins reward
500k-600k: 0-31,250 MediterraneanCoins reward
> 600k : 10 MediterraneanCoins reward (flat)

after that, subsidy halves in 1036k blocks (~1 year)

 - 34 million total coins
